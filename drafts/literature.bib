  abstract = {`Theory refinement is the task of updating a domain theory in the
	light of new cases, to be done automatically or with some expert
	assistance. [...] theory refinement under uncertainty is reviewed
	here in the context of Bayesian statistics, a theory of belief revision.
	[...] reduced to an incremental learning task as follows: the learning
	system is initially primed with a partial theory supplied by a domain
	expert, and thereafter maintains its own internal representation
	of alternative theories which is able to be interrogated by the domain
	expert and able to be incrementally refined from data. Algorithms
	for refinement of Bayesian networks are presented to illustrate what
	is meant by {"}partial theory{"}, {"}alternative theory representation{"},
	etc. The algorithms are an incremental variant of batch learning
	algorithms [...]' -- [http://www2.sis.pitt.edu/\~{}dsl/UAI/UAI91/Buntine2.UAI91.html
