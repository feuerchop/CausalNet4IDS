To run the demo, execute the script run_examples.

The script performs the following tasks:

1. loads a synthetic mulitmodal dataset with non-Gaussian modes.
2. Fits a Gaussian Mixture Copula Model (GMCM) to the dataset.
3. overlays the PDF contours on the scatter plot to show the goodness of fit.
