# CausalNet4IDS
CausalNet4IDS is a research project for reasoning cyber intrusions using a Bayesian networks approach.
We created a novel detection framework leveraing Copula Bayesian networks model, which is regarded an
efficient way for both parameter estimation and strucutre learning. The resultant directed acyclic graph
encodes causal relationships among variables, that is, relevant information describing why and how an
attack happens in modern cyber intrusion detection systems.
